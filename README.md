This is essentially a job application portal which is focussed on reducing 'cogntive load'.
1) Having a single form to fill and major details should be fetched about the user (GPA, Name etc ). This reduces the slots that a user would need to fill and since this details will be required everytime a user will only require to enter these details once.
2) Filtering of only relevant jobs using 'job match crtieria'
3) Chatbot which answers FAQ and allows the user to give feedback which can be used by developers to further enhance the system
